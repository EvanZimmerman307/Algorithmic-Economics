The company is renewing the fleet of its delivery trucks and you have been tasked with determining the allocation of trucks to each of the 22 sort centers. The head office of the company told you that the local branch will be allocated as many trucks as needed as long as you are able to to prove that they are necessary for operations. You were given the following parameters:\n",
